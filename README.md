# 🥷🏻 Python Bootcamp  
A 7-day intensive mini-bootcamp to learn Python fundamentals, build practical scripts, and prepare for deeper offensive security training.  

This repo is part of **The Cyber Lotus** journey--forging mastery by trial and by fire. 🔥  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repo and step into the dojo:  

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/python-bootcamp.git
cd python-bootcamp
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
python-bootcamp/
├─ scripts/        # Daily practice + practical hacker scripts
├─ tests/          # pytest unit tests
├─ docs/           # Cheatsheets and documentation
├─ README.md
└─ requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Goals
By the end of this bootcamp, the user will:
- Be fluent in Python syntax (loops, functions, data structures, exceptions).
- Master virtual environments + `pip`.
- Build five (5) to six (6) practical scripts (file handling, wordlists, sockets, brute-forcers, automation, etc.).
- Ship The Cyber Lotus Toolkit v0.1 with README + usage examples.

## 🧭 Roadmap
✅ Day 1: Environment, Neovim, basics, first scripts
⬜ Day 2–6: Lists, dicts, files, regex, networking, automation
⬜ Day 7: Assemble The Cyber Lotus Toolkit, final polish
⬜ Post-Bootcamp: Begin eJPT prep (09/06/2025)
